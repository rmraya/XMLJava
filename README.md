# XMLJava

Java library for handling XML in [Maxprograms](https://maxprograms.com) projects.

- Working support for [OASIS XML Catalogs](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec.html)
- Default attribute values resolution when parsing XML files with RelaxNG grammars
- XML indenter
- XML characters validation

Features in development:

- DTD parser
- Common XML Grammar handler for DTD, XML Schema and RelaxNG
